    version check). Returns the ``current_version`` to pass to ``load_model_snapshot`` /
    ``SnapshotPool`` so a stale-arch snapshot fails with a clean ``ModelVersionError``
    instead of loading mismatched weights.

    **The architecture TOGGLES must be passed in.** They default off (the encoder's
    ``get_features_extractor_kwargs`` carries no CLI toggles), but a run that enables any of them
    (e.g. ``--opp-belief-aux-coef>0`` → ``opp_belief_slots``, ``--use-popart``,
    ``--attend-unrevealed-opponents``) MUST thread its real values here — otherwise the gate compares
    a toggle-OFF "current" version against the run's own toggle-ON snapshots and FATALs on every
    pool/eval/distill load it is meant to protect.

    Imports are function-local to avoid an import cycle (state_encoder/features_extractor
