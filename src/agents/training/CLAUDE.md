# CLAUDE.md — Training (`src/agents/training/`)

Callbacks, reward manager, episode/turn tracking, stall detection, and the bot-eval pipeline.
**How to launch training** (commands, flags) lives in the root `CLAUDE.md` → Training /
Launcher; this file documents the subsystems' internal design. The `TurnDelta` fold and the
LiveView/TurnView/LegalActions read-models it consumes are documented in
`src/agents/battle/CLAUDE.md`. The obs-build performance gate is in
`src/agents/observation/CLAUDE.md`.

## Bot evaluation (subprocess, non-blocking)

**Flat schedule, full roster.** Eval fires every `EVAL_FREQ_STEPS` (2M steps) and plays
`EVAL_GAMES` (100) games per opponent — one cadence, one game count, applied uniformly to
every bot *and* every self-play sentinel (no maturity tiers, no per-opponent caps). The
roster is the full set of eight archetype bots — both the v1 and v2 of each
(`heuristic`/`heuristic2`, `staller`/`staller_v2`, `aggressive`/`aggressive_v2`,
`setup_sweep`/`setup_sweep_v2`) — plus `random` as the eval-only "is-the-model-broken"
floor (excluded from `win_rate_vs_bots`). All nine are the single source of truth in
`_EVAL_OPPONENT_SPECS` / `eval_opponent_names()`, shared by the bot path, the self-play
path, and the worker. There is no roster flag — every bot always plays, because they play
differently and the playstyle diversity is the point. The flat numbers are safe precisely
because eval is non-blocking and **skips a cycle while the previous one is still running**
(below): a heavier roster self-throttles to a sparser cadence instead of needing tuned
ceilings.

`PerOpponentEvalCallback` (non-self-play path) does **not** eval in-process. On each
scheduled step it snapshots the live weights (`model.save`) and spawns `--eval-workers`
(default 3) `main.eval_worker` subprocesses that **work-steal** opponents from a shared
pool (atomic `O_EXCL` claim files — a worker that finishes a cheap opponent grabs the
next, so uneven per-opponent cost self-balances), load the **frozen** snapshot, and play
against the shared Showdown server **without pausing training**. Each opponent writes
`result__<opponent>.json`; when all workers finish the parent merges them → TensorBoard +
TUI + best-model (the winning snapshot is promoted by copy, not re-saved). Forensic traces
land under `<run_dir>/eval_traces/step_<N>/<opponent>/`, alongside a per-cycle
**`eval_manifest.json`** (`write_eval_manifest`) recording exactly which model produced them
— `num_timesteps`, `git_hash` + `arch_signature` (read from the run's `metadata.json` /
`model_config.json`), and a `snapshot` pointer. The eval snapshot is normally ephemeral
(`model.save` → workers load → deleted in `_cleanup`) and the eval `step` rarely lines up with
a persisted `checkpoint_<N>_steps.zip`, so the prober can't reload the *exact* weights unless
they're retained: `--keep-eval-snapshots N` copies the snapshot into
`eval_traces/step_<N>/snapshot.zip` (keeping the N most-recent) and points the manifest at it.
The prober consumes the manifest to load the exact model, falling back to the nearest
checkpoint. **The trainer grooms the traces it writes**: after each cycle
`_prune_eval_traces` keeps only the `--keep-eval-trace-steps` (default 20) most-recent eval
step dirs, and `_prune_eval_snapshots` keeps the `--keep-eval-snapshots` (default 10)
most-recent snapshots — so `eval_traces/` stays bounded without any external task
(`python -m main.prober.groom` is the manual fallback). The eval summary itself is
written to `metadata.json` as a **top-level `latest_eval`** block (step-labeled, NOT
nested under a checkpoint) — robust to the async timing (an eval can finish after a
newer checkpoint, or before any checkpoint exists); `save_model_snapshot` carries it
forward so a later checkpoint never erases it. That top-level block is the canonical,
timing-robust record; **additionally, `record_checkpoint` stamps a point-in-time copy
of the then-current `latest_eval` into each checkpoint's entry** (both the per-checkpoint
sidecar `.json` and the run-level `snapshot_history` entry, under a `latest_eval` key) so
each checkpoint carries the most-recent eval+pool stats as of when it was saved. The
embedded block keeps its own `step`, so storing it under a possibly-newer checkpoint never
mislabels which weights were measured (`snapshot._read_latest_eval` reads it; the union
builder `_build_snapshot_entry` keeps sidecar + history in lockstep).

The frozen snapshot makes parallel eval correct (a worker can't read mutating in-memory
weights), and the fresh process returns all eval memory to the OS on exit (no fragmentation
in the trainer). Behaviors:
- A trigger that fires while the previous cycle still runs is **skipped** (logged) — on CPU
  an eval can outlast its interval; cadence just goes sparser.
- A worker crash is **logged-and-continued**, never fatal (its opponents are just missing
  for that cycle).
- **Graceful shutdown waits for eval to finish**: a scheduled restart is self-initiated by
  `GracefulRestartCallback` at a rollout boundary and the launcher won't force-kill until the
  child overruns the deadline by `--restart-grace-minutes` (20 min), so the drain budget is a
  full `_ABORT_EVAL_DRAIN_SEC` (10 min) AFTER the checkpoint is saved — long enough for a CPU
  eval to complete. Even the pathological forced-SIGTERM case (already overran → ~90s SIGKILL)
  is safe: the checkpoint is saved first, only the in-flight eval can be lost.
- **On resume the last eval is re-published to the TUI** from the resumed checkpoint's
  `metadata.json` (`replay_last_eval_to_tui`), so the eval panel isn't blank until the next
  cycle. This covers the **self-play `pool` block too** — the aggregate (`win_rate_vs_pool`,
  `mean_reward_vs_pool`, monotonicity, snapshot count) and every per-sentinel row are
  re-published from the saved block, with the saved step tags, so Pool/sentinel rows survive
  a restart exactly like the bot rows (no waiting a full cadence for fresh numbers). Safe
  because the pool only changes at an eval-collect — the same moment the block is persisted —
  so the saved rows match the pool reconstructed from `snapshots/`. A pre-seed eval persists an
  empty `sentinels` list, which isn't re-published (nothing to show yet).

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `--eval-workers` | `5` | Eval subprocesses per cycle; work-steal opponents from a shared pool. Capped at the opponent count. Self-play doubles this (→ `10`) since sentinel matchups run the model for both players. |
| `--eval-device` | `cpu` | Device for eval-worker inference. `cpu` decouples eval from the training GPU. |
| `--keep-eval-snapshots` | `10` | Retain the N most-recent eval weight snapshots in `eval_traces/step_<N>/snapshot.zip` (~27MB each; default ≈270MB) for bit-exact prober replay. `0` writes the identity manifest only; the prober then loads the nearest persisted checkpoint. The trainer auto-prunes to this cap each cycle. |
| `--keep-eval-trace-steps` | `20` | The trainer keeps only the N most-recent eval **step dirs** under `eval_traces/` after each cycle (`0` = keep all), so forensic data stays bounded. `python -m main.prober.groom` is the manual fallback. |

**TD-residual tail metric (`eval/td_resid_tail_*`).** Each cycle also folds a **left-tail
statistic of the per-decision critic surprise** δ(t) = r(t) + γ·V(s_{t+1}) − V(s_t) — the same
formula the prober uses (`main/prober/session.py::_td`, the single source of truth). `BattleRecorder`
accumulates δ live (one-step delayed backfill, closing each transition at the next `record()` when
the reward is finalized and V(s′) is known; the last decision has no δ). It costs **zero extra GPU**:
δ is computed only over the battles eval already captures forensically (where `need_aux=True` already
paid for V(s)), pooled per opponent (one `EvalRLPlayer` per matchup → `td_tail()`), and folded as a
**CVaR@5%** (mean of the worst 5%, `TD_TAIL_FRAC`; single min below `TD_TAIL_MIN_SAMPLES`=20). It
rides the exact win-rate plumbing — worker `result__<name>.json` → `merge_eval_results` →
`eval/td_resid_tail_vs_<opponent>` + `eval/td_resid_tail_mean` (TB + TUI), the `metadata.json`
`latest_eval` block (per-opponent + pool aggregate), and the append-only `eval_results.jsonl`. The
run's `model.gamma` is threaded into the worker (`base_cfg["gamma"]`) so the live δ matches the
prober's offline recompute (guarded by `td_residual_parity_fuzz_test.py`). More-negative = the critic
got blindsided more often — the **leading indicator for the critic-coverage obs work** (it moves in a
cycle or two, where saturated win-rate / gate-pinned `win_rate_vs_pool` / wide-CI ELO don't).

Each eval worker plays **one game at a time** (`_EVAL_SUBPROCESS_CONCURRENCY` = 1).
Eval inference is single-threaded, so overlapping battles only adds CPU/server
contention without parallelizing the forward — it measured slower, not faster.
Cross-opponent parallelism comes solely from the `--eval-workers` (5) subprocesses
work-stealing the pool.

## Self-play opponents (`--self-play`, gated behind pathology hunting)

When `--self-play` is set, `SelfPlayCallback` replaces `PerOpponentEvalCallback` and the
training opponents become frozen snapshots of the agent itself, drawn from a directory-backed
`SnapshotPool` (`snapshot_pool.py`; state reconstructed from `<run_dir>/snapshots/` on every
restart — no manifest). Design lives in `designs/ai_v5/`. Key behaviors:

- **Eval + promotion are NON-BLOCKING (frozen-snapshot subprocess), mirroring
  `PerOpponentEvalCallback`.** Self-play eval no longer runs in-process on the training thread.
  On a trigger step `SelfPlayCallback` freezes the live weights to disk (`model.save`) and
  spawns `--eval-workers`×2 (default 10) `main.eval_worker` subprocesses that **work-steal BOTH
  the bot roster AND up to 5 pool sentinels** from one shared pool (the worker's `_eval_sentinel` plays the
  frozen trainee greedy vs each sentinel stochastic); training continues immediately. On a later
  `_on_step` poll the parent merges per-opponent + per-sentinel results → `win_rate_vs_bots` /
  `win_rate_vs_pool` / `sentinel_monotonicity`, records to TensorBoard + the TUI + metadata.json
  (with the `pool` block), persists `win_rate_vs_bots` (feeds `heuristic_fraction` next run),
  saves best by **copying** the frozen snapshot, and — if `win_rate_vs_pool > --promote-threshold`
  — **promotes the FROZEN snapshot into the pool by file-copy** (`SnapshotPool.add_from_path`):
  the live model has advanced since launch, so re-saving `self.model` would promote the wrong
  weights. Sentinels load via `load_model_snapshot` against the pool's shared `model_config.json`
  using `current_model_version(mappings)` — a stale-arch snapshot fails with `ModelVersionError`,
  never loads silently. The **only** training-thread work per cycle is the `model.save` freeze +
  one cheap `opponent_default_stats` IPC at collect; all battles / model loads / inference run in
  the worker processes, and the trainer holds no live eval connections (the worker rebuilds
  opponents/teambuilders/mappings itself). Skip-while-running, worker-crash-logged-and-continued,
  graceful-shutdown `drain()`, and resume-republish all behave exactly as the bot path above. The
  launch→poll→collect→drain mechanics are the **shared** `eval_callback.spawn_eval_workers` /
  `merge_eval_results` / `persist_eval_snapshot` / `prune_eval_*` / `replay_last_eval_to_tui`
  helpers, so the two non-blocking paths can't drift. `--debug --self-play` uses a fast eval
  cadence (every 4k steps, 3 games) so a short CPU smoke exercises seed → pool eval → promotion.
- **Curriculum: thresholded ramp + LIVE per-episode fraction.** `heuristic_fraction`
  (`snapshot_pool.py`) is **0% self-play below `SELF_PLAY_START` (0.55)** — a weak model trains
  100% vs bots, no cycles wasted on a useless self-opponent — then smoothsteps `0.55→0.80` up to
  **90% self-play** (`HEURISTIC_FLOOR`=0.10 keeps a few % vs real bots for anti-forgetting). The
  three anchors are **configurable** — `--heuristic-floor` / `--self-play-start-wr` /
  `--self-play-full-wr` (defaults = the constants) thread through both the startup fraction and the
  live push, so a run can keep the coverage-punishing bots in the mix longer (raise `full` to ramp
  slower, raise `floor` for a bigger permanent bot slice). `--bot-weights name=w,…` additionally
  biases WHICH heuristic each episode draws (e.g. `aggressive_v2=3,heuristic2=3` → ~3× emphasis on
  the loss-analysis-flagged coverage bots; unlisted bots stay 1.0, omitted → uniform) — the weighted
  pick lives in `MaskableAgentWrapper._select_episode_opponent`, an O(1) in-memory `rng.choices`
  with zero per-step cost. All three default to the original behavior, so an unset run is unchanged.
  Crucially the heuristic-vs-pool split is **no longer fixed per process**: every training env
  picks its opponent **per episode** in `MaskableAgentWrapper.reset()` from a live
  `self_play_fraction`, and `SelfPlayCallback` pushes the fresh fraction (+ a `pool_generation`)
  to all envs via `training_env.env_method("set_self_play_target", …)` **after every eval**, so
  the ratio tracks measured strength mid-run with no restart. The opponent is a pure decision
  function over `env.battle2` (env.agent1/agent2 do the networking), so swapping it between
  episodes is free and safe — built `start_listening=False` (no idle connections), and the
  in-episode stale-decision path is untouched. The pool-vs-heuristic **coin flip is per-episode**
  (so the live fraction is honored exactly), but the pool **snapshot is (re)sampled+loaded only
  once per `pool_generation`**, NOT per episode: `load_model` deserializes a ~27MB MaskablePPO,
  and doing it every episode against an N-deep pool (LRU `lru_cache_size`=3) thrashed the workers
  — they blocked in `reset()` on the deserialize, dropping CPU to ~40% and FPS from ~1400 to ~500
  (regression fixed in `_select_episode_opponent`). A `pool_generation` bump (after a seed/promote)
  makes the worker re-scan + re-sample, so promotions become training opponents within a
  generation; diversity comes from 48 envs sampling independently + rotating each generation, not
  from per-episode churn. (`_n_pool_envs` / the `_maybe_engage_self_play` env-rebuild are gone.)
- **Seeding is GATED on competence; the pool is a SLIDING WINDOW (nothing pinned).** The pool is
  seeded only once win rate clears `SELF_PLAY_START` (at startup via `_maybe_seed_pool`, or the
  moment it crosses mid-run in `_collect_pending`), so the first self-play opponent is a
  *competent* model — never the random/weak step-0 seed of old. Nothing is pinned: the oldest
  snapshot (incl. the seed) ages out as the window slides past `max_snapshots`, so the floor
  stays a recent self; anti-forgetting is the heuristic floor, not a pinned seed.
- **Full roster (v1 + v2 of every archetype).** Training (`OPPONENT_CLASSES`) and eval
  (`eval_opponent_names()` / `_EVAL_OPPONENT_SPECS`) both use all eight archetype bots —
  `{Heuristic, Heuristic2, Staller, StallerV2, Aggressive, AggressiveV2, SetupSweep,
  SetupSweepV2}` — because they play differently and the extra playstyle diversity is the
  point. There is no roster flag; the same nine names (eight bots + `random`) feed every
  path. `Random` is eval-only (a cheap "is the model broken" floor, excluded from
  `win_rate_vs_bots`); it is never a training opponent.
- **Resume state in `summary.json`.** `SelfPlayCallback` writes
  `<snapshot_dir>/summary.json` each eval (`win_rate_vs_bots`, `self_play_fraction`,
  `last_eval_step`, `seeded`, `pool_generation`) — `SnapshotPool.persist_summary`/`load_summary`.
  Read at `train_rl_agent` setup → the initial `self_play_fraction` (so a strong resumed model
  starts at the right ramp level, not the 0% cold-start) and the seed-gate decision. Distinct
  from the prober's `eval_traces/*/summary.json`; the legacy `win_rate_vs_bots.txt` is still read
  as a fallback.
- **Opponents sample, they don't argmax.** Training opponents are built with `stochastic=True`
  (now the `RLPlayer` default) so the learner trains against the policy's full action
  distribution — a richer, less-exploitable signal than the greedy move. Temperature is
  `--self-play-temp` (default `1.0` = the policy's own distribution; >1 flatter). **The measured
  trainee is always greedy** (`stochastic=False`) — that's what gives `win_rate_vs_bots`
  (curriculum) and `win_rate_vs_pool` (promotion) a stable, comparable control signal. The bots
  are deterministic rule-based players. The **pool sentinels default to stochastic@`--self-play-temp`**
  (mirroring how they act as training opponents) — so a sentinel matchup is greedy-trainee vs
  stochastic-sentinel, a deliberate asymmetry that inflates `win_rate_vs_pool` by a ~constant
  temperature handicap (≈15–20 pts; the [ELO caveat](#elo--skill-rating) below). **`--eval-sentinel-greedy`
  makes the sentinels greedy too** (`_eval_sentinel` builds the opponent `stochastic=False`), so the
  matchup is best-vs-best and `win_rate_vs_pool` / the snapshot ELO reflect real skill (≈50% vs a
  recent self, ramping with sentinel age). It's eval-only — TRAINING opponents stay stochastic — and
  it auto-lowers `--promote-threshold` to `0.55` (else the handicap-free pool win rate never clears
  the 0.65 gate and the pool freezes). Default off so the live metric stays continuous until opted in.
- **Opponent snapshots are version-checked.** They load via `load_model_snapshot` (not a raw
  `MaskablePPO.load`), and `SnapshotPool` writes a shared `model_config.json` next to its
  snapshots, so an arch-mismatched snapshot fails with a clean `ModelVersionError` instead of
  loading mismatched weights.
- **The opponent RE-DECIDES on a stale decision; the trainee crashes** — split by who *owns* the
  decision. `SingleAgentWrapper` polls the opponent's `choose_move` on the *training* thread while
  POKE_LOOP mutates its battle, so by serialize time the captured snapshot (`ctx.legal`) can diverge
  from the live battle: POKE_LOOP parses an **in-flight turn-resolution during the model forward**,
  advancing `battle.turn` one ahead of `ctx.turn` (proven by the race trace — mutual Arena-Trap
  Dugtrios, the turn resolves mid-decision). `assert_decision_current` / `action_to_order` raise
  `StaleDecisionError`; handling then splits:
  - **Opponent** — its decision is *internal* to `step` (SB3 never sees it), so `RLPlayer.choose_move`
    catches the error and **re-decides on the now-current request**, bounded (`_OPP_REDECIDE_MAX`),
    with a valid default fallback only if the battle never settles. It must always return a valid
    order: SB3 has **no failed-step path** (a raise kills the `SubprocVecEnv` worker → parent hangs →
    worker-watchdog `os._exit`s → launcher restart). Each attempt's `embed_battle()` records its
    would-be decision into the rolling turn-history, so `choose_move` snapshots the tracker before
    the loop and `EpisodeTracker.restore()`s on a stale attempt — the superseded decision leaves
    **no phantom turn** in the opponent's turn-history obs (only the committed one survives; guarded
    by `redecide_rollback_fuzz_test.py` + `episode_tracker_test.py`). The re-decide guards only up to
    the order `choose_move` RETURNS; `SingleAgentWrapper.step` then re-serializes it via
    `self.env.order_to_action`, re-reading the battle **one more time** — a second, narrower window
    where it can finish/flip-to-wait under us (`ValueError ... not in valid orders ['/choose
    default']`). On that the wrapper falls back to the default order rather than crash (guarded by
    `single_agent_wrapper_test.py` + `order_to_action_race_fuzz_test.py`).
  - **Trainee** — its action is *SB3's*, computed outside `step` and not re-runnable mid-step, so a
    stale trainee decision **crashes** (`gen3_env`, no fallback): acting on it would corrupt its
    `(obs, action) → (reward, next_obs)` transition. Empirically it doesn't hit this — gated by the
    env's `race_get` request-wait (17 h vs-bots + self-play, zero trainee staleness).
  `_settle_opponent_battle` is a **pre-drain** that only trims how often the opponent re-decides — it
  can't drain *in-flight* messages, which is why re-decide (not settle) is the fix. The comprehensive
  `assert_decision_current` (every axis: moves+disabled, switches+species,
  force_switch/trapped/maybe_trapped/wait/struggle) is the detector; `train/selfplay_opp_redecide_rate`
  surfaces the resolved-race rate. **Full context — mechanism, the race trace, why it was hard, and the
  verification tiers — is in `race_fuzz_README.md`.** (`GEN3_FORCE_SELFPLAY` forces 100% self-play for
  the stress; `GEN3_RACE_TRACE=1` dumps the per-battle cross-thread interleaving into the
  `StaleDecisionError` **and** into the `race_get` silent-stall crash — see below. `StaleDecisionError`
  lives in `agents/action/mapper.py`.)
  - **Force-switch request-delivery deadlock (`_AsyncQueue.race_get`, `env.py`) — FIXED.** A
    *different* failure from the stale-decision race, and a latent bug **inherited verbatim from
    upstream poke-env 0.15.0**: `race_get` races a per-agent `queue.get()` against the
    `_waiting`/`_trying_again` coordination events, and can drop a request the server already
    delivered into the `battle_queue`. Two ways: **(1) stranding** — `asyncio.wait(FIRST_COMPLETED)`
    returns the instant any waiter completes, so an already-set **stale** event wins before the
    equally-ready `queue.get()` runs → `race_get` returns `None`, the agent is marked not-to-move,
    and its request sits unread; **(2) orphan theft** — `race_get` `cancel()`s the pending
    `queue.get()`, which a later `put` can resurrect to dequeue-and-discard the request.
    `_trying_again` goes stale because `env.step` cleared it only on the `None` path, and a
    re-request makes the battle non-`None`, skipping that clear. The trigger is the mutual
    Arena-Trap Dugtrio self-play mirror (trapped-switch `[Unavailable choice]` → stale
    `_trying_again`, then a faint → a `wait`+`forceSwitch` pair whose force-switch is stranded);
    rare (~1/8600 battles), so it only surfaced once self-play was on. **Fix:** `race_get` now
    `cancel()`s **and `await`s** the get to settle it (recovering its item, never orphaning it) and
    **prefers a queued battle over a stale event**, and `env.step` clears `_trying_again` the moment
    its agent receives a battle. Repro + regression guard: `forceswitch_deadlock_fuzz_e2e_test.py`
    (needs a `9XXX` server; `--widen` surfaces the timing race); unit coverage of both failure modes
    in `async_queue_disconnect_test.py`.
  - **Silent-stall watchdog (now a should-never-fire backstop).** Independently of the fix above,
    `race_get` bounds its wait by `_RACE_GET_TIMEOUT_S` (120 s, ~100× a normal step; override with
    `GEN3_RACE_GET_TIMEOUT_S`) and on a silent stall **raises `ShowdownException`** — a hard crash
    that propagates uncaught through the wrapper step chain to the SubprocVecEnv worker, so SB3
    discards the in-flight rollout (no fabricated transition reaches backprop) and the launcher
    restarts from the last checkpoint. It **crashes, never recovers in place** (recovering would feed
    PPO a stale `(obs, action) → (reward, next_obs)`). With `GEN3_RACE_TRACE=1` the wedged battle's
    interleaving is appended to the crash message via `race_trace.dump_recent()` (wedged battle
    ordered last so its newest events survive the launcher's last-100-line crash-file tail; the full
    trace is in `launcher_child.log`). `env.step` also emits `ENVSTEP` enter/race trace lines under
    `GEN3_RACE_TRACE` for debugging this handshake. Kept as defense-in-depth against any future
    request-delivery regression.
- **Self-play engages in the first process, not only after a restart.** The env is built before
  the model exists (the model needs the env's spaces), so on the first self-play process
  `_maybe_engage_self_play` seeds the pool from the loaded weights and rebuilds the env with
  pool opponents (then `set_env`). The worker watchdog is started *after* this, just before
  `learn()`. Later restarts find the pool already populated and skip the rebuild.
- **`--debug --self-play` exercises the real path** (seed → pool eval → promotion) on a fast
  eval cadence, so a CPU smoke against a `9XXX` server validates the wiring without disrupting
  the `:8001` training server. `selfplay_opponent_fuzz_test.py` covers the opponent load + legal
  play (both modes) + version check in-process via the local bridge (no server).

## ELO / skill rating (`elo.py`, `bot_elo_calibration.py`, `main.elo`)

Once training is mostly self-play **pool play**, win-rate stops being legible: the promotion
gate only promotes when `win_rate_vs_pool > promote_threshold` and the pool is a *sliding window
of recent selves*, so `win_rate_vs_pool` is a treadmill pinned near 50-65% **by construction** —
it cannot trend up however much the model improves; `win_rate_vs_bots` saturates near 100%. The
ELO subsystem gives a single **absolute** number that genuinely rises with skill, anchored to the
fixed bots.

- **No new battles.** Every eval cycle already plays the trainee (greedy) vs all 9 bots and vs
  up to 5 pool sentinels, `EVAL_GAMES` each — a full tournament-matrix row. `record_elo`
  (`eval_callback.py`, shared by BOTH callbacks) appends that row to an **append-only
  `<run>/eval_results.jsonl`** (`snapshot.append_eval_result_row`) — the canonical, restart-safe
  source of truth, distinct from the overwritten `metadata.json:latest_eval`.
- **The model = anchored Bradley-Terry** (`elo.fit_elo`): `P(i beats j)=σ((Rᵢ−Rⱼ)·ln10/400)`,
  fit in **batch** by penalized MLE (weak Gaussian prior keeps 100-0 records finite), SE from the
  inverse Hessian. Each bot is a player `bot:<name>`, each snapshot `snap:<step>` — a snapshot is
  the SAME player whether it appears as a cycle's trainee or later as a sentinel (unified by
  step), which links the whole ladder. Batch-BT (not online K-factor Elo) is drift-free and
  re-runnable; the fit is a few Newton steps over ~tens of players. **Not Glicko-2**: its
  volatility models skill drift, but snapshots are *frozen* — the drift is the *sequence* of
  snapshots (the ELO-vs-step curve); the per-player uncertainty (Glicko's valuable part) is the
  Hessian SE.
- **Anchor = a precomputed bot-vs-bot round-robin.** `python -m agents.training.bot_elo_calibration`
  plays all 36 bot pairs toward `--target-games` (default 5000) **in-process via the bridge — no
  server** (safe alongside a live run; it does use CPU — throttle with `--concurrency`), fits BT
  (`elo.fit_pairwise`, `random` pinned at `base`=1000), and writes the anchor. **Artifact split:**
  the immutable bot anchor (ratings, SEs, the 9×9 win-matrix, a non-transitivity `fit_quality`) is
  the only runtime input, so it lives in **`data/gen3_bot_elo_anchors.json`**; the raw game-count
  **store** (resume state) and the **heatmap** PNG are calibration provenance/viz, so they live with
  the ELO design work under **`designs/ai_v5/elo_calibration/`** (override with `--games-store` /
  `--heatmap`). The
  live/offline fits then **pin all 9 bots** to those high-confidence ratings and fit only
  snapshots — so a snapshot is well-grounded from its first cycle, and because the anchor is
  identical across runs, **snapshot ELOs are comparable run-to-run**. **Regenerate when bot logic
  changes** (the json records `git_hash` + date). Graceful fallback when the file is absent:
  `random` pinned at `base`, other bots float (rank/trend preserved, scale not cross-run-stable).
  Bots build once and are reused across pairs (`reset_battles` between) — building warms the data
  singletons (~4.5 s each), so per-pair rebuilds dominated cost; the full 5000-game job is a
  many-hour, run-overnight one-time cost.
- **Live (each eval cycle).** `record_elo` refits and records `eval/elo` + `eval/elo_ci` (95% CI
  half-width) to TensorBoard + the TUI dict, and stamps `elo`/`elo_ci` into `metadata.json:
  latest_eval` (so the resume-republish path shows ELO immediately after a restart — the saved
  headline is authoritative; and if a resumed checkpoint predates the `elo` field,
  `replay_last_eval_to_tui` **fits** the saved block's win rates via `elo.fit_from_block` to recover
  both the headline and each opponent's ELO, so the badge never blanks for a full cadence). The
  launcher
  surfaces a `🏅 ELO 1532 ±40` badge (`app.py::_elo_badge`) + an `elo` column in the eval panel:
  the model's rating on the `all` row, and each opponent's anchored ELO on its row
  (`_record_opponent_elos` records `eval/elo_vs_<bot>` + positional `eval/elo_vs_sentinel_<i>` to
  the TUI). The live number is the best estimate from data SO FAR (batch-BT is global → early
  points retro-adjust; the single-cycle per-sentinel ELO is rough — only the trainee is
  bot-anchored each cycle); the offline CLI re-fits canonically over the full per-snapshot history.
- **Offline (`python -m main.elo <run_dir>`).** Loads results (`--source auto|log|tb|meta` —
  `tb` **backfills an already-running run straight from TensorBoard, zero training change**), fits,
  and prints a ranked ladder + writes `elo_ratings.json` + an Elo-vs-step `elo_curve.png` (CI band
  + bot anchor lines). `--out` defaults to `<run>/elo/`; point elsewhere to analyze a LIVE run
  without writing into it.
- **Caveat (acceptable, noted in code):** by default the trainee is greedy but the sentinels are
  stochastic@temp, so a snapshot's rating blends greedy strength (when it's the cycle's trainee)
  with stochastic strength (when it's a later sentinel) — a roughly uniform shift that preserves the
  trend, but it does mean the same snapshot is scored in two regimes. **`--eval-sentinel-greedy`
  removes this** — sentinels play greedy too, so every snapshot is scored greedy in both roles and
  the ELO ladder is internally consistent (at the cost of a one-time scale shift vs prior cycles;
  the bot-anchored scale is preserved since trainee-vs-bot records are unchanged). Tests:
  `elo_test.py` (synthetic-ladder recovery, anchoring, perfect-score, loaders, `fit_pairwise`).

## Opponent distillation (`--distill-opponents`, off by default)

Distils the frozen self-play opponents into a **cheaper network** (the opponent forward is ~70% of
worker CPU) for faster rollouts — implemented in **`distill/` (has its own CLAUDE.md)**. The governing
constraint is the per-step barrier: distillation is **all-or-nothing** (one full-opponent worker
straggles and gates the batch), so the pool is only ever 100% distilled or 100% full. A single
idempotent **reconcile loop** (`DistilledOpponentManager`, run by `SelfPlayCallback` each eval + on a
throttle) keeps the on-disk distilled set in sync with the pool — **backfill on enable ≡ steady-state**,
no-op when nothing's missing — spawning the `distill/worker.py` subprocess per snapshot (gate =
fidelity + head-to-head). Distilled artifacts + their gate manifests live in `models/<run>/distilled/`
(the manifest is the per-snapshot source of truth; `summary.json` gets only a re-publish block);
cleanup is automatic via the reconcile's window-eviction. The env's `MaskableAgentWrapper` does the
atomic full↔distilled opponent switch (`set_distill_active`). **Observability:** `_reconcile_distill`
records five `distill/*` scalars (frac/all_distilled/ready/running/exhausted) to TensorBoard + the
launcher dashboard, and emits launcher **Events** for each gate result (deployed/escalated/exhausted
with h2h + speedup), the atomic full↔100%-distilled switch, and backfill spawns — surfaced in the TUI
as a `⚗ distilled 100%`/`⚗ distilling N%` badge + a `distill/*` metrics block + Events lines (zero
footprint when off). **Full design: `designs/ai_v5/distill_integration.md`
(§8 all-or-nothing, §7 restart resilience); module map: `src/agents/training/distill/CLAUDE.md`.**

## Rollout collection: sync barrier vs `--async-rollout` (`async_vec_env.py`)

The default `SubprocVecEnv.step()` is a **per-step barrier** — the trainer waits for the slowest of
N env workers every step, so a slow battle turn / heavy opponent forward / oversubscription jitter
stalls the whole batch and the GPU policy-forward never overlaps CPU env-stepping. `--async-rollout`
swaps in **`AsyncSubprocVecEnv`** (per-env `send_step`/`poll_ready`/`recv_step` over the pipes +
**drain-safe `env_method`** — the eval callback's `set_self_play_target`/`set_distill_active`/
`opponent_default_stats` fire mid-collection, so the override stashes in-flight step results before
any barrier RPC to avoid a pipe desync) and **`collect_rollouts_async`**, dispatched by
`InstrumentedMaskablePPO.collect_rollouts` when `model._async_rollout` is set.

The collector keeps every worker continuously in-flight, batch-forwards whichever envs are READY
(dynamic batch), and writes each env's transition into **its own buffer column**
(`MaskableDictRolloutBuffer`); collection ends when every column has `n_steps`. It is **exactly
on-policy** — PPO freezes the policy during collection, so this is a *scheduling* change (overlap
forward with stepping, drop the max-latency barrier), NOT an APPO-style algorithm change. Bookkeeping
(`num_timesteps`, GH-#633 timeout bootstrap, `_update_info_buffer`, `_last_*` carry-over, per-column
GAE) mirrors the stock loop exactly. The per-decision **mask rides in the Dict obs**
(`obs["action_mask"]`, = `last_ctx.mask`), so no per-env `env_method` and no wrapper change.

**Measured FPS (bridge, GPU forward, steady-state, heuristic opponents):** +20% at `--n-envs 16`;
**+14% at the production `--n-envs 64` (1489→1695)**; `--async-rollout --n-envs 32` matches `sync@64`
FPS with half the envs (≈half the env/bridge RAM). Off by default (stock `SubprocVecEnv`), ignored
under `--debug`. Compounds with distillation (async attacks the barrier; distill attacks the per-step
opponent CPU). Caveat: benchmarked with heuristic opponents — re-bench under `--self-play` for the
production-regime number. Full design + benchmark table: `designs/ai_v5/design_async_rollout.md`.

## Process liveness guards (`watchdog.py`)

Two daemon-thread watchdogs keep a hung/abandoned run from lingering:

- **`start_subprocess_watchdog`** — for the `SubprocVecEnv` path. A crashed worker leaves the
  parent blocked on a pipe `recv` forever; this thread polls `processes` and `os._exit(1)`s the
  moment a worker dies with a nonzero exitcode. Started *after* env construction (and, in
  self-play, after `_maybe_engage_self_play` rebuilds the env), right before `learn()`. It is a
  **no-op on the `--debug` DummyVecEnv path** (no worker processes to watch).
- **`start_orphan_watchdog`** — for the `--debug` smoke path, which has no worker watchdog. A
  smoke run is a child of the launching shell/agent; if that parent dies the run is orphaned
  (PPID changes) and a hung smoke (e.g. a vanished `9XXX` server) would otherwise sit as a
  multi-GB zombie indefinitely. This thread captures the launching PPID up front and `os._exit`s
  when `os.getppid()` *changes* (by-change, not `== 1`, so PID-namespace subreapers count).
  Started early in `main()` inside the `if args.debug:` block — before team/env/server setup —
  so a startup hang is covered too. **Real launcher-managed runs keep a live parent and never
  arm it.** Regression test: `watchdog_test.py` (subprocess-driven orphan + no-false-fire).

## Showdown port threading (the `server_config` seam)

`train_rl_agent.py --showdown-port <port>` builds **one** `ServerConfiguration` in `main()`
via the single constructor `localhost_server_configuration(port)` (in
`poke_env.ps_client.server_configuration`) and threads it to **every** Showdown client —
the training-env players (carried into the `SubprocVecEnv` spawn workers via the env-factory
closures), eval, and self-play. Every player-creating callback takes a `server_config` param
(defaulting to port 8000 for standalone use) and builds its players from it — **never** from a
bare `LocalhostServerConfiguration` constant. `server_port_threading_test.py` is the
regression guard: it fails if any of these callbacks hardcodes the default port instead of
threading the configured one (the original bug had the now-retired replay recorder connecting
to :8000 while training ran on :8001; eval forensic traces inherit the same guard).
There is no environment variable; `train_rl_agent.py`'s own default is 8000, but the **launcher**
overrides it to 8001 before forwarding (see `src/main/launcher/CLAUDE.md`). The launcher
forwards `--showdown-port` verbatim (it strips only launcher-owned flags).
