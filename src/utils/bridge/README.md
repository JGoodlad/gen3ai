# Pokémon Showdown Bridge

This directory contains the bridge logic used to access the Pokémon Showdown simulation library directly from Python, without requiring a running server.

## Overview
By bridging Python to Node.js, we can utilize the actual `pokemon-showdown` codebase (located in `deps/`) as a library. This allows us to perform complex operations like **Team Validation** using the official Smogon rules and logic, but with the performance of a local function call.

## Components

### Team validation (request/response)
1.  **`validate_team.js`**: A Node.js script that imports the Showdown `TeamValidator` and `Teams` modules. It reads a team and format from `stdin` and outputs a validation result as JSON.
2.  **`team_validator.py`**: The Python wrapper that manages the subprocess communication with the Node bridge.

### Local battle (streaming) — run whole battles with no Showdown server
A second bridge runs *entire battles* in-process via Showdown's `BattleStream`, so a
poke-env `Player` can play with **no websocket server, no port, no usernames, no
matchmaking**. Unlike the team validator, it relays the **protocol text** each side sees,
so it feeds poke-env's parser exactly as the live server would — the parsing/encoder
pipeline runs byte-for-byte the same; only the transport changes (poke-env issue #907).

1.  **`local_sim_bridge.js`**: A Node streaming relay. `START`/`CHOOSE`/`FORCELOSE`/`END`
    on `stdin`; per-side, base64-framed protocol chunks (`p1 <b64>` / `p2 <b64>`) on
    `stdout`. One battle per process. Uses `getPlayerStreams()` so Showdown does the
    per-side channel demux. Accepts an optional fixed PRNG `seed` for reproducible battles.
2.  **`battle_stream_client.py`**: `BattleStreamClient(PSClient)` — a poke-env transport
    that subclasses the (vendored) `PSClient` **from outside** `src/poke_env/` (it modifies
    no poke_env file). No websocket; translates poke-env's `/choose …` onto the bridge and
    no-ops websocket ceremony (`/utm`, `/timer on`, `/leave`, `/challenge`, …).
3.  **`local_battle_runner.py`**: `run_local_battles(player1, player2, n_battles, *,
    seed=None)` — a drop-in for `player1.battle_against(player2, n_battles=…)`. It spawns one
    bridge per battle, fabricates the `>battle-…`/`|init|` room header the sim does not emit,
    and routes each side's protocol to the right player's client. Build the players with
    `start_listening=False` (no websocket opens); the runner swaps in the bridge transport.

This powers the `*_fuzz_test.py` suite. (A few timing-sensitive checks stay on the live
server as `*_fuzz_e2e_test.py` — e.g. `effectiveness_fuzz_e2e_test`.)

## Why use a Bridge?
- **Serverless**: No need to start or manage a Pokémon Showdown server process.
- **No contention**: Each call/battle is fully isolated — no shared server lifecycle, no
  username collisions, no port. Multiple fuzz tests can run at once without fighting.
- **Speed**: Local function calls beat websocket round-trips (the fuzz suite is *faster*
  on the bridge than on the server).
- **Accuracy**: It uses the *exact* same Showdown code as the live server (same `deps/` files).
- **Reproducible**: the battle bridge accepts a fixed PRNG seed.

## Usage

### Team validation
```python
from src.utils.bridge.team_validator import validate_team_locally

result = validate_team_locally("gen3ou", team_text)
if result["valid"]:
    print("Team is valid!")
else:
    print(f"Errors: {result['errors']}")
```

### Local battle (used by the `*_fuzz_test.py` suite)
```python
from utils.bridge.local_battle_runner import run_local_battles

# Players must be built with start_listening=False so no websocket is opened.
await run_local_battles(my_player, opponent, n_battles=40)   # no `npm run showdown`
```
