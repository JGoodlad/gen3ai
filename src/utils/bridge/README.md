# Pokémon Showdown Bridge

This directory contains the bridge logic used to access the Pokémon Showdown simulation library directly from Python, without requiring a running server.

## Overview
By bridging Python to Node.js, we can utilize the actual `pokemon-showdown` codebase (located in `deps/`) as a library. This allows us to perform complex operations like **Team Validation** using the official Smogon rules and logic, but with the performance of a local function call.

## Components
1.  **`validate_team.js`**: A Node.js script that imports the Showdown `TeamValidator` and `Teams` modules. It reads a team and format from `stdin` and outputs a validation result as JSON.
2.  **`team_validator.py`**: The Python wrapper that manages the subprocess communication with the Node bridge.

## Why use a Bridge?
- **Serverless**: No need to start or manage a Pokémon Showdown server process for logic-only tasks.
- **Speed**: Standalone validation is significantly faster than websocket-based communication.
- **Accuracy**: It uses the *exact* same logic as the live server because it imports the same files.

## Usage
```python
from src.utils.bridge.team_validator import validate_team_locally

result = validate_team_locally("gen3ou", team_text)
if result["valid"]:
    print("Team is valid!")
else:
    print(f"Errors: {result['errors']}")
```
